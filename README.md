# Islandora OAI Download Link

Islandora utility module that adds a custom request handler for the Islandora OAI module. Currently under development, do not use in production yet.

## Requirements

* [Islandora OAI](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_oai)

## Usage

This module adds "download lnks" to the OAI metadata generated by Islandora OAI's default response handler. To use this module,

1. Select the "Islandora OAI with download links" request handler in the Islandora OAI admin settings at `admin/islandora/tools/islandora-oai`. 
1. Save the configuration.
1. Click on the request handler's 'configure' link.
1. If you want to add a download link to your MODS records, configure the MODS element template (note that links added to DC records are not configurable).
1. In the new "Download links" fieldset, configure your "Content model to link mappings for download links" and ranges of allowed IP addresses.
1. Save the configuration.

The changes this module makes to the default OAI metadata are limited to adding the elements containig the direct download links, and metadata generated by requests that do not fall within allowed IP ranges or for objects not configured in a mapping remain unaffected.

If enabled and configured, this module adds the following elements to the OAI metadata formats/prefixes:

* oai_dc: `<dc:identifier>http://localhost:8000/islandora/object/testing:38/datastream/OBJ/download</dc:identifier>` (note that this <dc:identifier> is added as the _first_ <dc:identifier> if any already exist in the metadata)
* mods: `<location><url access="download">http://localhost:8000/islandora/object/testing:38/datastream/OBJ/download<</url></location>` (note that the template for this element is configurable, but must be a top-level MODS element)
